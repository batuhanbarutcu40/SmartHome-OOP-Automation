Smart Home Manager (Java)
A Java-based simulation of a smart home ecosystem designed using advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Technical Highlights:

Abstraction & Interfaces: Used interface (Controllable, Schedulable) and abstract class (SmartDevice) to create a flexible and extensible device hierarchy.

Polymorphism: Managed various device types (SmartLight, SmartSpeaker) within a single ArrayList<Controllable> and processed them dynamically.

Type Checking & Casting: Implemented instanceof checks and downcasting to access specific behaviors like scheduling.

Code Structure: Adheres to the principle of "Program to an interface, not an implementation."
